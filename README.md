# Hasse Diagrams Using Python 📚
cause _i_ _hate_ _myself_ ✨ and why not. <br>
Generate a Hasse diagram for the power set P(𝑆) of a given set 𝑆={𝑎,𝑏,𝑐} using NetworkX in Python.

##  Project Overview 📜
This project visualizes the subset inclusion relationships in 𝑃(𝑆) the power set of 𝑆={𝑎,𝑏,𝑐} using a Hasse diagram. Hasse diagrams are helpful for visualizing partially ordered sets (posets) where elements are linked by subset relations. 

## Diagram Explanation 📈
Nodes: Represent each subset in 𝑃(𝑆)P(S)
Edges: Represent subset relations, connecting smaller sets to larger ones by inclusion.

## Usage 🚀
**Run the script:**

```bash
python hasse_diagram.py
```
*View the output*: <br>The program will display a Hasse diagram for P(S) with all subset inclusion relations.

## Installation and Setup 🧰
**Clone this repository:**
```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hasse-Diagram-PowerSet.git
```
```bash
cd Hasse-Diagram-PowerSet
```
**Install required packages:**
```bash

pip install networkx matplotlib
```

## Code Explanation 📝
Define the power set and subset relations: The script defines the power set of S={a,b,c} and uses directed edges to represent subset inclusions.
Visualize with matplotlib: Using NetworkX’s shell_layout for a structured, hierarchical view of subset relations.

## Built With 🛠️
- Python 🐍
- NetworkX 📈
- Matplotlib 📊
